msgstr "动力矿车"

msgid "A minecart with furnace is a vehicle that travels on rails. It can propel itself with fuel."
msgstr ""

msgid "Place it on rails. If you give it some coal, the furnace will start burning for a long time and the minecart will be able to move itself. Punch it to get it moving."

msgid "Rail"

msgstr ""

msgid "Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. Powered rails are able to accelerate and brake minecarts."
